# OST data

# Concerns:
# (1) The below query produces N-1 rates, where N is the number of raw
# measurements in the database.  This occurs because it calculates the
# non_negative_derivative() by first calculating the difference between two
# successfive measurements, and it does not assume a 0 preceeds the first
# measurement.  It's possible there is a query trick like a subselect, that can
# alter this behavior.  Needs research.
#
# (2) It apears to be impossible to get influxdb to include the jobid and
# lustre target \"name\" as fields in each row.  It cannot be done by
# specifying them directly as non-aggregate fields are not allowed in queries
# using group by; and last() and other aggregation functions operate ONLY on
# field keys, not tag keys (see for example
# https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.5/query_language/functions/#last).
# Using a subquery e.g.
# "select jobid,fubar_rate from (select derivative(fubar) # as fubar_rate group by jobid)"
# does not work because fubar_rate is for some reason not available to the
# outer query and those fields are NULL or 0 depending on fill.
#
# Notes:
# Field "name" holds the name of the Lustre target from which the measurement
# was taken.  The "GROUP BY \"name\"" clause is required to force influxdb to
# use the correct pair of measurements when it calculates the difference
# produced by non_negative_derivative().

# Raw data
