# OST data

# Concerns:
# (1) The below query produces N-1 rates, where N is the number of raw
# measurements in the database.  This occurs because it calculates the
# non_negative_derivative() by first calculating the difference between two
# successfive measurements, and it does not assume a 0 preceeds the first
# measurement.  It's possible there is a query trick like a subselect, that can
# alter this behavior.  Needs research.
#
# Notes:
# Field "name" holds the name of the Lustre target from which the measurement
# was taken.  The "GROUP BY \"name\"" clause is required to force influxdb to
# use the correct pair of measurements when it calculates the difference
# produced by non_negative_derivative().
